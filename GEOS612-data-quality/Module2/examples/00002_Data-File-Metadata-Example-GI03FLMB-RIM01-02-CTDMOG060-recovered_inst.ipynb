    "The data file to be used in Module 1 Lab assignment is a NetCDF file. The following is a brief description of the file type, its data structure, and why it is suitable for the Metadata exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### File Type: \n",
    "\n",
    "- The file type used for this exercise is the Network Common Data Form file (NetCDF) with file extension \"*.nc\".\n",
    "- NetCDF is based on a binary file storage mechanism.\n",
    "- It is a self-documenting data storage and data access method that is used in the geoscience filed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " #### Data Structure:\n",
    " \n",
    "- NetCDF is commonly used for storing and interchanging multidimensional scientific data variables (Schema 1).\n",
    "- This file type includes data (observation values) and descriptive information about the data (Metadata). \n",
    "- Data are displayed through a dimension such as time, date, latitude, longitude, or depth. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Why NetCDF File?\n",
    "\n",
    "- The NetCDF files are easy to manipulate.\n",
    "- Metadata is entered in a structured way, so it is easy to retrieve.\n",
    "- Metadata entries can use a free text format and a good number of words.\n",
    "- Other file types do not all share these characteristics. Such files are: excel (.xlsx), text (.txt), and comma separated (.csv) file types."
